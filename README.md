# Technical Writing Portfolio
These documents are a sampling of my technical writing projects.

## Amazon Systems Manager (July 2020 - Sep 2021)
The Amazon Systems Manager team consisted of four writers, including myself. I was assigned to the capabilities: **Fleet Manager**, **Run Command**, **Parameter Store**, and **State Manager**. These documents were written in XML.

Notable documentation projects:
* The Systems Manager guide is one of the oldest AWS user guides. Systems Manager used to be a feature of EC2 before it was spun off into its own service. This meant that there was a lot of outdated language in the guide. I reviewed the entire user guide (almost 3,000 pages) to ensure that the documentation was accessible and met our style guide standards.
* Reconfigured the Parameter Store and State Manager sections. When I audited these sections, I found that there were multiple duplicate sections and missing information. I condensed these sections and made them adhere to the same standards as the rest of the documentation.

## Amazon Nimble Studio Classic (Sep 2021 - Sep 2023)
I inherited this guide from the original documentation writer when I transferred into the Creative Tools team. These docs were originally written in AsciiDoc, but I converted the docs into XML.

Notable documentation projects:
* Converted AsciiDoc to XML and wrote up an internal wiki detailing how to partially automate this process.
* Removed the Artist Tutorial section and created a separate guide. This involved creating a new documentation package, updating the landing page package, and requesting new translations.
* Oversaw the manual translation of the documents to Japanese. A large portion of our customer spoke Japanese and noted how awful the Japanese docs were, so I requested that we manually translate the documents to Japanese.
* Transitioned the documents to the current "Classic Guide". In 2023, the Creative Tools team decided to launch a new version of Nimble Studio. However, we still had customers using what we dubbed "Classic Nimble Studio". I investigated how customers could create similar infrastructure to Nimble Studio, and documented the processes. I also merged the artist guide back into the User Guide.

## Amazon Nimble Studio File Transfer (April 2022 - Sep 2023)
I was the original writer for these documents. These documents were written in XML.

Notable documentation projects:
* Wrote the File Transfer guide from scratch. This involved requesting a new package, updating the landing page, requesting translations, and creating new entities for the guide. This user guide includes the installation guide, user manual, and release notes.
